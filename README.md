Welcome to the Shadow Shift Chrome Extension repository! 

This extension allows you to **<i>easily switch any webpage/PDF documents to a dark theme</i>** with just a click, providing a more comfortable browsing experience, especially in low-light environments.

## Motivation
Initially I found it difficult to read PDF books on my Chrome Browser at night. I thought about having the ability to toggle between light/dark mode for a PDF file in a chrome extension would be cool. Then I thought "**Why just PDF files - when we can do this for any webpages.**"

## Features
- One-click Dark Theme: Enable dark mode on any webpage with a single click.
- (*Soon*) Customizable: Customize the darkness level and other aspects of the dark theme to suit your preferences.
- (*Soon*) Global Enable/Disable: Easily toggle the extension on or off as needed.
- (*Soon*) Intuitive Interface: Simple and user-friendly interface for seamless browsing.

## Installation
*We will soon publish this extension to Chrome Webstore.*

As of now, you can follow these steps to get it up and running:
- Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
- Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.
- Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
- Click on "Load unpacked" and select the directory where you cloned/downloaded the repository.
- The extension should now be installed and ready to use!

## Usage
Once the extension is installed, you can start using it immediately. Here's how:

- Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
- Toggle the switch to enable or disable the dark theme.
- Enjoy browsing in the dark mode!
- (*Soon*) You can also customize the dark theme by clicking on the settings icon within the extension popup.
